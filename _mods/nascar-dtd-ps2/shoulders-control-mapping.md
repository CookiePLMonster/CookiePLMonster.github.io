NASCAR Heat 2002, the first PS2 game from Monster Games, shipped with 4 control schemes to choose from.
One of those control schemes was called "Shoulders", and mapped throttle/brake to R2/L2.
This translates really well to modern gamepads, allowing the player to use triggers for precise throttle control.

For unknown reasons, NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona removed this control scheme.
What makes this decision even more puzzling is a fact that NASCAR DtD was also released on GameCube,
a console with pressure sensitive triggers in place of PS2's shoulder buttons!

With this code, I restored a full "Shoulders" controls set for the game, copied from NASCAR Heat 2002.
