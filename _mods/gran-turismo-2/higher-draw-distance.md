Fair warning -- this cheat doesn't do wonders. The game's draw distance is determined by the track data itself, and so it's impossible
to increase it arbitrarily. However, Gran Turismo 2 has a slightly higher draw distance in replays than it does in races.
With this cheat, I enabled the replay draw distance in races.

Benefits from (but does not require) a [Use 8MB RAM for polygon buffers](#8mb-ram) cheat and an emulated console with 8MB RAM.
