By default, Gran Turismo and Gran Turismo 2 both use very aggressive LODs for AI cars. The highest LOD level is reserved for the player, with lower LOD levels used by the AI
depending on distance from the camera. When playing the game on the native resolution it's nearly impossible to notice, but of course with upscaling LODs become much more obvious
and jarring.

To counter this, I created a cheat forcing all cars on the track to use the highest LOD level, previously reserved for the player. As a result, the game looks far better than originally.
