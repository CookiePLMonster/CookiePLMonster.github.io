{:.disclaimer}
This cheat code applies only to the First Preview demo. Final Gran Turismo 4 versions allow selecting units from the options menu.

We had to wait until Gran Turismo 4 to have a proper measurement units selection menu in the game. Before that units were locked to the specific game version, most notably locking NTSC-U versions of the games to use imperial units. While in Gran Turismo 1 and 2 units were fully hardcoded, turns out Gran Turismo 3 and later include code handling multiple speed, power, and torque units, although they are predetermined by the userâ€™s choice of language.

With these codes, measurement units may be freely picked, just like in Gran Turismo 4. Whether it means using metric units in the NTSC-U versions, or imperial in PAL versions, the cheat code can be modified to force any selection of such.

Available units:
* Power:
  * 0 - PS
  * 1 - HP
  * 2 - BHP
  * 3 - CV
  * 4 - kW
  * 5 - PF
* Torque:
  * 0 - kgf.m
  * 1 - ft.lb
  * 2 - NM
