Modern Patch made by aleko2144. I contributed several fixes to it.

A patch for the game that fixes some bugs and flaws in the original game, as well as introduces some improvements.

## Featured fixes

* Fixed a bug that positioned interiors too low.
* Experimental patch: fixed a bug in vehicle upgrade system that causes the fuel tank to become half empty when changing cars with an additional tank installed.
* Fixed 1-second freezes when entering Greystone and improved loading times.
* Corrected direction of dust particles flying from cars.
* The collision handling parameters between dynamic objects have been reconfigured to reduce vehicles "sticking" during contacts.
* The parameters of the external camera has been adjusted (it no longer flies away).
* Corrected behavior of road trains (reduced semi-trailer skidding in arcade mode, improved maneuverability in simulation mode).
* Improves traffic behavior on narrow roads (north road to Mercury).
* Partially fixed bugs in rendering rear-view mirrors that occurred when playing in 16x9.
