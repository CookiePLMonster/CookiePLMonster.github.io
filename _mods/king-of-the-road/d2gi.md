D2GI made by REDPOWAR. I expanded it with support for King of the Road (digital releases) and with several new fixes.

D2GI adapts the game for modern PCs by wrapping DirectDraw7 + Direct3D7 to Direct3D9. It's developed to replace the existing wrappers from GOG and dgVoodoo.

## Featured fixes

* Fixes graphical artifacts ("Rainbow" bug, broken transparency, etc.).
* Supports any resolution and aspect ratio.
* Windowed mode, borderless, fullscreen.
* 32-bit color rendering.
* Compatibility with HT 8.1, KotR 1.3, SEMod 1.2.
