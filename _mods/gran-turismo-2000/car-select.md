Built upon the original research of **Xenn765**.

This patch adds a full car select feature to the game, allowing the players to choose from a list of six cars:
* Lancer Evolution V GSR '98 (the default car)
* Toyota Altezza RS200 '98
* Subaru Legacy B4 RSK '98
* Mazda RX-7 Type RS '98
* Nissan Skyline GT-R V-spec (R34)
* Honda NSX Type S ZERO (J)

## Features

* Lets users select the car in-game with DPad left/right.
* Features all available colors for each car. Although AI drivers always used fixed colors, all car models feature a selection of colors taken straight from Gran Turismo 2.
  Notably, Honda NSX has 12 available colors, which is quite a bit compared to Evo V's 5 available colors!
* Keeps the starting grid unchanged, so the player starts in the 6th position regardless of their car of choice.
* Remembers the selected car after the race, like the stock game does with the selected color.
* Makes the selection look fully native by including a fade-out effect when selecting cars, much like in Gran Turismo 3.
* As UI assets for other cars are not present in the files, Lancer Evo badges, performance characteristics, and color names are hidden for other cars.
