{:.disclaimer.info}
This patch is shipped with PCSX2 starting with v2.5.85.

If controlling the car with face buttons or triggers isn't your cup of tea, most Gran Turismo games also offer an alternative -- throttle and braking
can also be controlled with the right stick. With this patch, GT2000 also gets this feature.

This patch can be used alongside **Trigger control mappings**, but doesn't require it.
