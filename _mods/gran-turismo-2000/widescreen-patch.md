An improved 16:9 widescreen patch.
* The game FOV is switched to Hor+ everywhere, including the menus and replays; FOV is no longer manually increased to match the original game's 4:3 vertical FOV.
* All menu and HUD elements, except for the fonts, have been adjusted for widescreen. This also includes the intro movie.
