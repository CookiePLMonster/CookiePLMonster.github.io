Yakuza Remastered Collection is a collection consisting of Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4, and Yakuza 5,
released on PC in January 2021. At the time of writing this, the games have several issues, one of them being high CPU usage.
Since currently no official patches have been released yet, this patch aims to resolve those issues in Yakuza 3 and Yakuza 4
(Yakuza 5 might come later).

## Featured fixes:

* CPU usage has been cut down as much as reasonably possible. Yakuza 3 CPU usage has been cut down drastically; Yakuza 4 sees smaller gains, but the difference should still be noticeable.
* A low level keyboard hook potentially causing issues with slow typing speed has been removed.
* Worked around a crash occurring occasionally after finishing battles with a Heat Action.

**This patch only works with the Steam version of the game!**
