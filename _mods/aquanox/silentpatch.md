SilentPatch for [AquaNox](https://store.steampowered.com/app/39630/AquaNox/),
fixing widely reported mouse control issues.
A bug present only in the first game (AquaNox 2 fixed it) would cause the game to drop mouse input
frequently when mice with high polling rate have been used. It's now been fixed
the same way AquaNox 2 did.

## Featured fixes:
### Bug fixes

* Fixed issues with stuttery/unresponsive mouse and keyboard input when using mice and/or keyboards with high polling rate
