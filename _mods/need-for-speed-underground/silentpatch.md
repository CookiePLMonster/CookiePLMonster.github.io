This small SilentPatch primarily addresses the infamous "Magazine 22" issue, where a bug in the game's implementation made the unlock requirements nearly impossible to meet.
Additionally, several smaller bugs have also been fixed.

## Featured fixes

* Fixed the unlock requirements for Magazine 22, which is awarded for setting a Drift Track record. The magazine is now awarded for beating the average lap high score,
  ensuring the requirements are fair regardless of the number of laps in the event.
* Drift events now display the total score as their High Score instead of style points.
* Fixed a random game crash when saving if the system date format exceeded 11 characters.
