This plugin for Crazy Taxi restores the original licensed brands from the Arcade and Dreamcast versions.
The original version of the mod was made by [Alexvgz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqDbjGuaY4awoKs8J-6DBUA)
and involved replacing textures; after some investigation I found a way to restore brands by editing the code instead.
This has also allowed for complete restorations of FILA and Pizza Hut logos, and for a restoration of FILA
as a possible customer destination - unlike other licensed brands, FILA was not only made unmarked,
but also made unreachable by customers.

## Features
* Restored original licensed destinations:
  * Pizza Hut (Pizza Parlor)
  * Kentucky Fried Chicken (Fried Chicken Shack)
  * FILA
  * Tower Records (Record Store)
  * The Original Levi's store (Clothing Store)
* Restored FILA (Shoe Rack) as a possible destination for customers, previously cut completely
* Restored original voice lines for licensed destinations

**This modification does not (and will not) restore the original soundtrack from the Dreamcast version.**
