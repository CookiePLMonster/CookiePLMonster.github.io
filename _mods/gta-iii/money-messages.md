This modification restores some early left behind code found in Grand Theft Auto III which had money amounts display in game after blowing up vehicles, picking up money, etc,
just as it displayed in older GTA titles such as Grand Theft Auto and GTA2. The same code was left in Vice City too, so the modification re-enables this feature there as well.

Money pop-ups will now show when:
* Picking up a money pickup
* Hitting a vehicle with another vehicle
* Blowing up a vehicle
* Destroying a police helicopter
