While the Xbox prototypes and the final game (on all platforms) target 60 FPS, both PS2 prototypes are locked to 30 FPS.
This patch lifts the FPS cap, allowing the game to hit 60 FPS. When using this cheat in PCSX2, the default configuration tailored for the final version
of Juiced prevents these prototypes from maintaining a stable 60 FPS, even with an overclocked emulated CPU.
For an optimal experience, several settings should be changed as follows.
**Please make sure to use Per-Game Settings to change those, as changing those settings globally is guaranteed to cause problems with other games,
including the final version of Juiced:**
* Set <kbd><samp>EE Cycle Rate</samp></kbd> to **130%**.
* Enable <kbd><samp>Enable Instant VU1</samp></kbd>.
* Disable <kbd><samp>Enable Game Fixes</samp></kbd> (in the <kbd><samp>Advanced</samp></kbd> tab).
