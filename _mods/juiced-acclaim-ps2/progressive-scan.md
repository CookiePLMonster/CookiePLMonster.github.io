The {% include elements/time.html date="2004-07-28" %} build and the final version of Juiced include an option to switch the game to use Progressive Scan
by holding **X**{:style="color:rgb(124, 178, 232);font-family:monospace, monospace"} + **â–³**{:style="color:rgb(64, 226, 160);font-family:monospace, monospace"},
while the {% include elements/time.html date="2004-06-11" %} build doesn't implement this option yet. With this cheat, Progressive Scan is enabled also on this build.

{% include setup-instructions.html platform="ps2" %}
