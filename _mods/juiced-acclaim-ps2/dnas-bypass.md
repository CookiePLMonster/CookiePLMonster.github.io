This [DNAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNAS) Bypass cheat allows the game to go online through [OpenSpy](http://openspy.net/)
by bypassing a defunct authentication service from Sony. My tests were done only on the June build; July build can go online too, but I've not had much success creating a lobby.
