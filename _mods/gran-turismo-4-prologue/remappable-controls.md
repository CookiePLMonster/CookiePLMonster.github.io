Gran Turismo 4 Prologue, despite being a (somewhat) full release, does **not** feature control remapping.
The game internally loads and saves mappings, but no menus exist, leaving the feature unused.

With this code, I "exposed" mappings to the PNACH file, so users may freely map controls however they wish.
By default, the code ships with stock mappings, so make sure to modify the code to your needs.

**Please remember to read the instructions included in the PNACH file and adjust the code to your preferences!**
