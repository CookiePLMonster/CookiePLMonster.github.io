{:.disclaimer.info}
This patch is shipped with PCSX2 starting with v1.7.5712.

This patch adds four "modern" control schemes to the game, with throttle/brake sensitivity tuned for the range of triggers. Those are:
* Setup E -- a cut mapping from the prototype builds of Hot Pursuit 2.
* Setup F -- mapping inspired by the Xbox version of Underground.
* Setup G -- mapping inspired by the Type 2 setup from the PS2 version of Underground.
* Setup H -- mapping inspired by the Xbox version of Hot Pursuit 2.
