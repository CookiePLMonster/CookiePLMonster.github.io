game-series: "gta-vc"
excerpt: "Do a German III TV commercial!"

This modification restores some beta GTA III code, allowing the player to blow up the Airtrain.
In the final game version, the player could only destroy a Dodo flying above the city,
yet destroyable Airtrain was shown in some places before III release (such as a German TV commercial).
