Before Hotline Miami 2 was released, the official system requirements for the game listed Windows XP as being
compatible with the game. Though at the time of release, it turned out that posted requirements in fact came from
the first installment of Hotline Miami. As a result, the game cannot run on XP and users who preordered the game are
not able to play now.

I decided to make some quick research around the issue and it turned out re-adding XP support is not terribly hard.
This unofficial patch aims to make the game playable on XP.
