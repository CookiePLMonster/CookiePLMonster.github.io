{:.disclaimer.info}
This page is for the in-game unlocker. For a standalone executable, check out [Yakuza Arcade Machines Player]({% link _games/vf5fs.md %}#yamp).

This plugin for Yakuza 6: The Song of Life and Yakuza: Like a Dragon modifies in-game Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown arcades
to boot into a previously hidden console mode instead of the arcade mode. This enables users to play a nearly
complete Xbox 360 version of Virtua Fighter 5, natively on PC!

The plugin does not modify Virtua Fighter 5 in any way -- what you see is exactly how the shipped game works.
At the moment I don't plan to address any of the game's shortcomings in this plugin.

# Known issues and shortcomings
* Saving doesn't work
* To start the game, coins must be inserted twice (Y/Triangle on the gamepad)
* English texts are cut off, as this build of VF5FS seems to be a Japanese SKU with English texts
* Pause menu is tricky to access and resuming the game does not unfreeze gameplay

This plugin only works with the Steam version of the game!
