When creating a new driver profile in NASCAR DtD, the birth years of the player are limited
to the **1925-1986** range. In 2021 that limit doesn't really make sense anymore,
so in this cheat, I lifted it enough to future proof it for a very long time -- with valid dates now being in the **1900-2100** range.
