Yakuza Arcade Machines Player is a launcher that allows you to run Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown,
standalone and native, on PC, provided you own a Steam copy of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life.

## Known issues and shortcomings

* Audio is not implemented.
* No online features are implemented and are unlikely to be implemented for a long time.
* Only Yakuza 6 is supported so far, Yakuza: Like a Dragon is planned to be added later.
* Just like when playing through in-game arcades, the game renders at fixed 720p and stretches to fullscreen. Proper high resolution rendering support may be added later.
* Offline Versus cannot be played with a keyboard and a gamepad. For now, two gamepads are required.
* Keyboard bindings are hardcoded for now. Please refer to <kbd>F1</kbd> &rarr; <kbd><samp>Controls</samp></kbd> for a list of controls.
