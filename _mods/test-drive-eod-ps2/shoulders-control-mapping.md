NASCAR Heat 2002, the first PS2 game from Monster Games, shipped with 4 control schemes to choose from.
One of those control schemes was called "Shoulders", and mapped throttle/brake to R2/L2.
This translates really well to modern gamepads, allowing the player to use triggers for precise throttle control.

For unknown reasons, Test Drive: Eve of Destruction removed this control scheme.
What makes this decision even more puzzling is a fact that Test Drive EoD was also released on Xbox,
a console with pressure sensitive triggers in place of PS2's shoulder buttons!

With this code, I modified one of the alternate controls sets to swap L1/R1 with L2/R2.
