Since Gran Turismo games have always offered full control remapping, it's possible to utilize triggers on modern controllers for throttle/brake,
much like most modern games do. However, unlike in newer Gran Turismos, doing this in the PS2 games results in a mediocre experience -- analog sensitivity
is tailored for analog buttons of the DualShock 2 controller, and therefore inputs are heavily scaled. In practice, this means that anything over ~half the trigger
press is already registered as a 100% input, so precise throttle control is hard. With this code, I've removed this scaling as much as reasonably possible,
so now 100% input registers from a near full press of the trigger, therefore making the experience closer to how the later Gran Turismo games handle it.
