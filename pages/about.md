Hi, I'm **Adrian** -- game developer by day; modder and reverse engineer by night. I try to fix things.
In the cyberspace, I go by **Silent** or **CookiePLMonster**.

For as long as I can remember, I've been tinkering with games in one way or another.
The earliest <q>attempts</q> I can recall included replacing sounds in Driver or modifying textures in various freeware games,
and trying to modify Java scripts in Street Legal Racing Redline (with poor results, however).
My first more serious work dates to 2008, when I first dived into Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and [its scripting
engine](https://gtamods.com/wiki/SCM_language){:target="_blank"}. I eventually wanted to do more than what game scripts allowed for,
and so, after around two years I got into reverse engineering the game and started experimenting with increasingly
complex assembly hacks (yes, I did code in assembly before learning any high-level languages).
Eventually, this led to me starting to use C++ in mid-2011.

Things went at their own slow pace until late 2013 when I released SilentPatch for Grand Theft Auto III and
Vice City -- a modification fixing bugs in games. This proved to be much more popular than I'd anticipated
and led to releasing more SilentPatches, first for San Andreas a few months later; then for other games,
totally unrelated to GTA.

The most significant breakthrough came when I released [Hotline Miami 2 XP Support Patch]({% link _games/hm2.md %}#hm2-xp)
in March 2015, a few days after the game's release.
Not only it got officially endorsed, but it also allowed me to establish first contacts in the game development scene which
eventually allowed me to get my first job (which I hold till this day).

What am I up to these days?
* I provide professional support and consultancy services for re-releasing old PC games on modern computers
  (see entries marked as <q>Independent</q> in my [Portfolio]({% link pages/portfolio.md %})). I specialize in upgrading outdated proprietary codebases for modern standards,
  ensuring compatibility with contemporary compilers, operating systems, and hardware. I am also able to fix such issues without the source code. \\
  **If you are a publisher with plans to re-release a classic game on digital storefronts and need assistance getting it to run well,**
  **drop me a line -- even if you donâ€™t have access to your game's source code!**
* I port and co-develop games as my day job (see my [Portfolio]({% link pages/portfolio.md %})).
* I still release new modifications and patches (see my [Mods & Patches]({% link pages/mods.md %})). My hobby work spans across over 40 games on multiple platforms.
* I occasionally contribute to numerous open-source projects, such as [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.io/){:target="_blank"} or [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/){:target="_blank"}
  (see my [GitHub activity](https://github.com/CookiePLMonster){:target="_blank"}).
* I regularly contribute to [Redump Disc Preservation Project](http://redump.org/){:target="_blank"}, concentrating my efforts on preserving PC discs.
* I regularly contribute to [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/){:target="_blank"}, documenting the state of various PC games and troubleshooting issues.
