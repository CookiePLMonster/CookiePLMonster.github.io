# PCSX2

When installing cheat codes, refer to the instructions related to "cheats". Otherwise, refer to "patches".

1. Locate your `patches` (or `cheats`) directory. If your PCSX2 installation is portable, the directory resides next to PCSX2's executable file.
   Otherwise, it's located in `Documents\PCSX2`.
2. Put the downloaded `.pnach` file in that directory, ensure the file extension is **not** `.pnach.txt`.
3. Launch PCSX2, right click the game you've installed content for on the Game List and select <kbd><samp>Properties...</samp></kbd>.
4. Navigate to <kbd><samp>Patches</samp></kbd> (or <kbd><samp>Cheats</samp></kbd>) and enable the item(s) you want to use by ticking the <kbd><samp>Enabled</samp></kbd> box.

5. Verify that patches (or cheats) have been activated correctly by launching the game.
   If everything was done correctly, a '<samp>X game patches are active.</samp>' (or '<samp>X cheat patches are active.</samp>') message will show on startup in the top left corner.
