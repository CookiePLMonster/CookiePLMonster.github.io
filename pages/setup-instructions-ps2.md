These instructions are general and apply to every PS2 download from this website.
These steps apply to any game.

These instructions target PCSX2 on Desktop and AetherSX2 on Android.

1. [Downloading cheats](#downloading-cheats)
2. [Applying cheats](#applying-cheats)
    * [PCSX2 (Desktop)](#pcsx2)
    * [AetherSX2 (Android)](#aethersx2)

# 1. Downloading cheats {#downloading-cheats}

1. The download button opens a GitHub page with the cheat. View the raw cheat file by pressing *Raw*.
2. Right click and select *Save As...* (PC) or press the Download button (Android) on the page with the cheat.
3. Save the file, changing its extension from `.pnach.txt` to `.pnach`. For that, you need to change the file type to *All Files*.
   The rest of the filename **must be preserved!**

# 2. Applying cheats {#applying-cheats}

## PCSX2 {#pcsx2}

1. Locate your *cheats* directory. If your PCSX2 installation is portable, the directory resides next to PCSX2's executable file.
   Otherwise, it's located in *Documents\PCSX2*.
2. Put the downloaded `.pnach` file in that directory, ensure the file extension is **not** `.pnach.txt`.
3. Launch PCSX2 and ensure that *System* -> *Game Settings* -> *Enable Cheats* is ticked.
4. Verify that cheats have been installed correctly by launching the game and checking the window name of the PCSX2 console.
   If done correctly, the window name should contain "*[X cheats]*" somewhere. Obviously, it should not say "*[0 cheats]*".
