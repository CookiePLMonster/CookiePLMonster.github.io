Hey there! This is a very quick update for SilentPatch for The Godfather.
Don't expect any new fixes as it's merely a maintenance release, correcting issues with current set of features.

Changelog:
* Fixed an issue where Film Archive movies would not display when viewing them **after** the game has loaded.
* Reconstructed the code to account for DRM better. Previously, it's been reported that many localized EXE versions would not work with SPGF. They should be fine now!

This release also ships with an updated Ultimate ASI Loader, so please grab all the files from the archive, not just the ASI.


The first issue actually ended up being relatively interesting, but I'm not sure if it makes sense to detail it here.
Let me know in the comments if you'd like to see a writeup on this particular bug, since the issue behind this code is not game specific
-- most notably, it's the same kind of issue which plagues [SkyGfx mod for GTA when used with SA-MP](https://gtaforums.com/topic/752667-relsasamp-sampgraphicrestore/).
