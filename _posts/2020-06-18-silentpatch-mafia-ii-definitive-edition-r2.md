A small note before I start -- the website now has a dark/light mode switch! Click a <i class="fas theme-icon"></i> button in the top right corner (might have to expand the menu with a <i class="fas fa-bars"></i> button on mobile devices first) to switch the theme!

So... Mafia II: Definitive Edition has been updated. Here's an official changelog from the official website:

> Addressed a reported concern that the 2K Account icon was sometimes getting stuck on the screen \\
> **[PC] Addressed a reported concern that legacy saves were sometimes not working on Steam** \\
> [PS4] Improved game performance on PlayStation®4 consoles \\
> [PS4] Addressed a reported concern that the "Enforcer" trophy would sometimes not unlock on PS4 \\
> Addressed reported concerns related to game audio \\
> Addressed reported concerns related to refining gameplay

The **bold** entry has been reported by me! Very nice.

Does it mean SilentPatch can be deprecated? Sadly not. You might notice that there is no mention of
a fix for saving issues for users with non-ASCII user names. Sure enough,
based on my tests I can confidently say that **this has not been fixed**.
I'm disappointed because the legacy saves issue was fixed despite being a tiny annoyance,
while an actual major (breaking for some) bug regarding saving has not been addressed. Better luck next time?

Because of this, SilentPatch has been updated to work with the 18.06 patch. Since the legacy saves issue
is fixed officially, my fix for that has been removed. Everything else remains as is.

This release also introduces a new tiny change -- Mafia II Classic and Mafia II Definitive Edition
can now run together at the same time. While for regular players this sounds useless, it might be useful
for modders.
