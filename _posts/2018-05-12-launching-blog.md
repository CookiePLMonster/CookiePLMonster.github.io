About time! My very own, personal blog. Better late than never, right?
<!--more-->

I've been thinking about a blog for a while, as those who follow me on social media (if you don't, links are on
the bottom of this page!) might have noticed my online activity is increasing over time.
Rather than spreading articles, code snippets, rants and mod submissions all over the cyberspace, having them centralized in there
seems like a far better idea.

What can you expect to see here?
* Updates on various modifications and other projects I take part in
* Technical articles (in fact, the main reason I'm creating the blog just **now** is an article like this)
* Personal portfolio and download pages for ~~all~~ most game modifications I have worked on (but not yet)
* Personal rants (maybe)
