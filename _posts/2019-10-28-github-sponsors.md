Hey! This is just a very quick announcement that I've been recently accepted into
the [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) program, a new Patreon-like service from GitHub.
My page is now up and running and while it's still very barebones, it should do the trick for now.

What do I offer in return for sponsorships? As mentioned on the sponsorships page, not much for now -- so far I'm only
able to offer a place in credits for those who sponsor. I want to avoid perks like early/exclusive access,
because I believe fragmenting the community is not a good idea -- that said, I may come up with something better
later which also will not lock people out!

The link to my Sponsors page is now added to the footer of the website, next to a PayPal link.
If you wish to visit the page, either scroll down or click here: \\
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/{{ site.theme_settings.github }}" class="button github" role="button" target="_blank"><i class='fab fa-github-alt'></i> Become a sponsor</a>
