*TL;DR - if you are not interested in a short rant of mine and came here to get the cheat codes,
head to the [**Sony PlayStation**]({% link _games/consoles/ps1.md %}) page for a list of games and cheat codes.*

***

Recently I've been using [DuckStation](https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation), a relatively new, modern PS1 emulator, quite a lot.
Not only it's fast **and** accurate, but also includes modern features like PGXP, cheats, post-processing shaders, and is aimed to include overclocking soon.
Of course, me being me I could not *only* play those games -- so I started experimenting with cheats enhancing the games.

While cheats making some games widescreen and/or 60 FPS exist, I was not satisfied with how incomplete some of them are and
how the information is spread around numerous websites and random Excel spreadsheets; this has affected Gran Turismo 2 the most,
which has 10 versions and the versions I have did not have proper cheats anywhere!

Combining these issues with the fact that I figured out how to work with PS1 games by using [no$psx](https://problemkaputt.de/psx.htm),
another debugging-oriented PS1 emulator, I decided to do something about it -- so I'll be hosting my cheat codes on the blog,
just like mods for PC games; starting with cheat codes for PS1 games, but it may or may not expand to more consoles and emulators.

# Current and planned codes

I have created a [**Sony PlayStation**]({% link _games/consoles/ps1.md %}) page, listing PS1 games I currently have codes for.
At the moment of writing this post, it includes the following codes:

* Gran Turismo
  * 60 FPS cheat -- improved the existing cheat by re-enabling tire smoke, which was originally removed at 60 FPS for performance reasons[^1].
* Gran Turismo 2
  * 16:9 Widescreen hack -- a better widescreen hack that does not cut off the objects on screen edges; originally made by **HugoStanced**,
    I contributed with additional research and ported it to different game versions.
  * 60 FPS cheat -- improved the existing cheat by re-enabling tire smoke, which was originally removed at 60 FPS for performance reasons[^1].
  * Metric units code -- a cheat changing imperial units to metric units in the NTSC-U version of the game.

[^1]:It goes without saying that to be able to use 60 FPS cheats without slowdowns, you might need to overclock the PS1 in your emulator of choice.

Later on, I plan to add more codes -- such as the metric system for NTSC-U versions of Gran Turismo, No UI patches, etc.

Since every emulator has its way of supporting cheats, for setup instructions please refer to the documentation of your emulator of choice.
