Hey! This short post servers just as a heads up that *Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition* has reached a new version!
Quoting the official website:

> *Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition* is **an ongoing project** of enhancement packages that add various visual, audio, and bug improvements for the PC version of the game.
> Notable examples of what the enhancements improve on is the use of a widescreen camera in the game; higher display resolutions; removal of prominent audio bugs;
> PlayStation 2 quality audio and fog; better controller support; and much more. The use of these enhancement packages,
> made by a collaborative team of wonderful modders and programmers, makes for a definitive Silent Hill 2 HD experience.

I contributed several things for this release, namely:
- Added XInput based controller vibration
- Added an option to allow movement and menu navigation with DPad, like on PlayStation 2
