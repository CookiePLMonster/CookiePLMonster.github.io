Woop! Four and a half months after the blog has launched, it's now kind of finished!
You might have seen some changes (most notably, a new banner!) appear through the last few days, but with this batch of updates it should be more or less feature complete
(not content complete, mind you!).

If I got your attention this far, why not go through all the new features!?

# Categories
This website bases on [Type on Strap](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap) theme that supports tags, however in my version they were always disabled.
As the size grows in content, I figured it's time to make those return in form of **Categories**. From now on, posts are going to be categorized:
* **Articles** -- any "meaningful" content, like post mortems or other tech revelations from myself.
* **Releases** -- new mod releases and other announcements.
* **Progress Reports** -- mod-related posts which do not fit in neither of the above. I can't promise Progress Reports as exciting as the ones posted by Dolphin or RPCS3 developers, however.
* **Other** -- everything else! Rants, personal opinions on games and anything else, announcements like this or, occasionally, [cats](https://i.redd.it/oomaydkommo11.jpg).

Bear in mind that this list may change at some point.

# Finished Mods & Patches page
Until now, that page was a mess, but no more! Now the page contains most mods sorted by game -- or, in the case of GTA, sorted by series, then games.\\
That also means all SilentPatches are finally listed on the website -- better late than never!

All image assets and design for this have been done by [Ash R.](https://twitter.com/Ash_735) -- kudos to the man!

**NOTE:** Not all mods are listed yet -- expect the other entries to appear very soon! I also plan to introduce a **Tools** section in nearby future.

# Polished Portfolio page
Portfolio page also has received a minor makeover -- now entries are more consistent styling wise, and display their respective game logos upon hovering.\\
Once again, all image assets have been provided by [Ash R.](https://twitter.com/Ash_735)!

# Support link
Last but not least, some people have been asking if there is any way to support me -- now there is!
If you want to buy me a cookie, some beer or provide some cat food,
you can use a PayPal button on the very bottom of this page!

Any donations are absolutely voluntary and you should **not** feel bad if you don't send one -- it's just a minor extra motivator
for myself and not anything pressing!
