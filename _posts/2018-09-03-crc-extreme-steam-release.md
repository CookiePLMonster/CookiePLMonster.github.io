It's real -- a single bugfix for a graphical issue caused a chain of events, and now CRC Extreme is (almost) **out on Steam!**

Cross Racing Championship Extreme is a relatively nice racing game from [Invictus Games](http://invictus.com/), released in 2005.
Sadly, it was haunted by a relatively severe graphical artifact present on nearly all modern GPUs -- driver models would be corrupted
and trees would randomly fly around!

<em>You are not wrong - there really are trees in the sky.</em>
</p>

With it fixed, Raxat aka [ImageCode](http://image-code.com/) (you [may remember the name from a post about Street Legal Racing Redline v2.3.1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-15-slrr-proof-of-fix %}))
sent the fix back to Invictus, and they **liked it so much so they immediately wanted to re-release the game on Steam!**

I can proudly say I took part in refreshing the game for modern standards -- CRC Extreme on Steam can boast improvements such as:

* Fixes for original bugs
* Much better widescreen support
* Increased resolution of graphical effects
* New graphics options (such as MSAA and windowed mode)

With all fixes in place, it's safe to say the game looks much better than it used to:

<em>Now we're talking.</em>

You can see all those improvements in a short gameplay I recorded:

I am amazingly excited all this became reality and I hope you'll like the end result! A **huge** thanks to Raxat for getting the ball rolling and keeping it all in check later -- 
if it wasn't for him, the fix would have never made it back to Invictus Games and the game would probably not make its way to Steam 😄

# What's next?

You certainly can expect a post-mortem on the shader fix which started it all -- that should come in nearby future.

Once the game releases on Steam I will almost certainly keep close tabs on it together with Invictus and Raxat,
in order to keep a sensible level of post-launch support for the game.

Worth to mention that there are even more games from Invictus Games running on the same engine -- such as [LA Street Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Street_Racing),
which is a very similar game to CRC Extreme as far as the technical side goes.
Nobody has any plans related to it right now -- but who knows, perhaps that could change if CRC Extreme ends up being successful!
