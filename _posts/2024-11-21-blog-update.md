Hello! Over the past month, I pushed multiple additions to the blog that are worth covering in a separate post.
I made numerous improvements to help people stay up to date with my smaller mod releases, not just the "big" blog posts
published together with notable updates. Let's get to it!

# The state of SilentPatch

After the newest SilentPatch for the Grand Theft Auto games [was released last month]({% post_url 2024-10-25-silentpatch-goes-open-source %}),
I immediately started working on a hotfix to address some mod conflicts and incompatibilities.
I'm working on [a second hotfix](https://github.com/CookiePLMonster/SilentPatch/milestone/3){:target="_blank"}, so if
you're experiencing issues listed there, they will be resolved soon!

# Updates feed

Notable mod releases on my blog usually accompany a blog post, but smaller ones are not. Therefore, if you are not following
me on any social media and are not checking the Mods pages regularly, you may have missed the release of e.g.
[Triggers Control Mappings for NFS Hot Pursuit 2 (PS2)]({% link _games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-2-ps2.md %}#triggers-control-mappings).
I now come up with a solution -- in the top navigation bar, you may find a new [**Updates**](/updates/) feed!
Available as a page or an RSS feed, the **Updates** feed will list information about:
* New mod releases.
* Mod updates, no matter how small.
* New pages on the blog, for example, new games added to the [Bonus Codes]({% link pages/bonuscodes.md %}) page.
* Relevant blog updates, like... this one, for example ðŸ˜‰.

At this moment, I backfilled this feed with all updates from 2024. I recommend checking back regularly (or subscribing to the RSS feed)!

# New social links

I recently diversified my social media presence to more places and reflected this in the social media links available at the bottom of this page.
Now, alongside [<i class="fab fa-x-twitter"></i> X/Twitter](https://x.com/{{ site.theme_settings.twitter }}){:rel="me" target="_blank"},
you may also follow me on [<i class="fab fa-bluesky"></i> Bluesky]({{ site.theme_settings.bluesky }}){:rel="me" target="_blank"}
or [<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i> Mastodon]({{ site.theme_settings.mastodon }}){:rel="me" target="_blank"} (I'm not too active on that one).
See you there!

# Flipper Zero applications

I've been toying around with my Flipper Zero for a while and published several apps for it, but I never got to feature them on this blog.
Now, the little dolphin tool [has its own space]({% link _games/misc/flipper-zero.md %})! Currently, you may find two apps available for download there.
