title: "Tokyo Xtreme Racer (2025): Dynamic Day/Night Cycle Mod"
---

This Lua script enables a full day/night cycle in the Ultra Dynamic Sky UE5 plugin, used by the game.

## Features

* Full 24-hour day/night cycle with realistic sunrise and sunset times reflecting the path of the sun in real-life Tokyo.
* Adjustable simulation speed, by default configured to 30x speed (1 real second = 30 in-game seconds).
* "Dusk-Night-Dawn" mode, where the simulation loops only through the night.
* Randomized clouds/fog each night.
* Persisted time of day and weather in Parking Areas. The time resets only once the player returns to the garage.
* An option to freeze time with <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>.
* Fully compatible with manual time/weather adjustments done by Car_Killer's Time of Day/Weather Control script.
