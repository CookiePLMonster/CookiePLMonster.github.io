A small update for SilentPatch for Yakuza Kiwami 2 has been released:
* Cap Karaoke to 60 FPS to resolve a softlock when starting the minigame together with Haruka.

This update also upgrades the internals of the patch heavily to make it as resilient as other modern SilentPatches,
which may result in even better compatibility with other mods.
