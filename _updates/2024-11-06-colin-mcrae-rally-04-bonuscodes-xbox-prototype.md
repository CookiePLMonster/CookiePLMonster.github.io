title: "Bonus Codes Generator for Colin McRae Rally 04 updated with support for the prototype builds"
game-series: ["cmr-04"]
---

Thanks to [RibShark](https://x.com/RibShark), the [Bonus Codes Generator]({% link _bonuscodes/cmr-04.md %}) for Colin McRae Rally 04 now supports the prototype builds of CMR04.
As of the time of writing this update, only an Xbox prototype is known to use this revised version of the generation algorithm, but any future prototypes that may surface
in the future may potentially use it too.
