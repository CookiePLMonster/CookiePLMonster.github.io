This patch for [Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 (PS2)]({% link _games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-2-ps2.md %})
adds four "modern" control schemes to the game, with throttle/brake sensitivity tuned for the range of triggers. Those are:
* Setup E -- a cut mapping from the prototype builds of Hot Pursuit 2.
* Setup F -- mapping inspired by the Xbox version of Underground.
* Setup G -- mapping inspired by the Type 2 setup from the PS2 version of Underground.
* Setup H -- mapping inspired by the Xbox version of Hot Pursuit 2.
