title: "60 FPS patches for NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona"
---

I published 60 FPS patches for PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions of NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona.
Both previous and next games from Monster Games using the same engine targetted 60 FPS, while Dirt to Daytona was an outlier.
Because of this, the game (unsurprisingly) supports 60 FPS flawlessly.
