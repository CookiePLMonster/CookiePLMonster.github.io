---

SilentPatch for the PC and PS2 versions of **Need for Speed: Underground** is now out:

* Fixed the unlock requirements for Magazine 22, which is awarded for setting a Drift Track record. The magazine is now awarded for beating the average lap high score,
  ensuring the requirements are fair regardless of the number of laps in the event.
* Drift events now display the total score as their High Score instead of style points.
* Fixed a random game crash when saving if the system date format exceeded 11 characters (PC only).
* Fixed a buffer overflow issue in the UI display of opponent names. This resolves a bug where Samantha's name appeared corrupted during races (PS2 only).
