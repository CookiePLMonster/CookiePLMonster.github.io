{:.disclaimer.warning}
Known imperfect dumps of Gran Turismo 2000 circulate online. If PCSX2 doesn't list any patches you've installed, you may be using one of those dumps.
To make them discoverable with this version of the game, change the CRC part of the patch file name from `55CE5111` to `E9A7E08D`.
No other changes are necessary.
