Danganronpa 1-2 Reload merges the renowned Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc and Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair.
The Danganronpa series revolve around the elite high school; Hopeâ€™s Peak Academy. Every year the school selects "Ultimate" students along with one average "Ultimate Lucky Student".

> I briefly helped with this project (that based on our previous ports of Danganronpa and Danganronpa 2), mostly fixing some newly discovered issues and making sure
> that both games work properly when merged together.
