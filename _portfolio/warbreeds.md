WarBreeds is a strategy game where the objective is to become the ruler of the fallen Empire.
Defeat your enemies and steal their genetic material to expand your clanâ€™s skills and firepower.
Engineer and customize your army with a vast mixture of advanced bio-technological weaponry.

> I've been contracted with consultation and bugfixing of the game in preparation for a digital release on Steam and GOG.
> I shipped appropriate DirectDraw and CD Audio wrappers and rolled out a stub DirectPlay wrapper to remove an invasive dependency
> on a legacy Windows component not installed in the OS by default,
> gracefully disabling the game's obsolete networking functionality, albeit with an option for the user to bring it back
> should they want to get it running at their own discretion.
>
> I also fixed several original bugs in the game that could render the Explorer unusable if the game didn't shut down gracefully,
> effectively performing a Denial of Service "attack" on the Explorer.
>
> The game's source code has been lost, so all work was done via reverse engineering.
