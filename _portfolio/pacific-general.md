> I've been contracted with consultation and bugfixing of the game in preparation for the Steam release.
> I troubleshooted the existing compatibility issues and shipped an appropriate DirectDraw wrapper,
> and additionally patched the game's binary with several compatibility and QoL bugfixes.
>
> The game's source code has been lost, so all work was done via reverse engineering.
