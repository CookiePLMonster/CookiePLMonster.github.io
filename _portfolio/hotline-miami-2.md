The sequel to the acclaimed top-down shooter Hotline Miami, the killing continues in Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number.
There are more characters, smart twists on the original gameplay, and a continuation of the surreal story.

> I started working on the game after its initial release and largely contributed to making **Level Editor** a reality.
