Surgeon Simulator 2 is the most recent instalment in the critically acclaimed Surgeon Simulator series.
This time, the team is injecting a delirious dose of co-op adrenaline straight into the heart of the original game, cranking everything up to a whole new level. 

> I briefly joined the project late in development, and fixed several memory leaks that would cause the game to crash often.
